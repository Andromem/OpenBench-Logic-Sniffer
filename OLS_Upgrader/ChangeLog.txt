8/17/2010 Test Release 2.12
	-Dynamic memory depth is controlled by selecting channel groups in the client.
		-4 channel groups selected makes 6K memory depth available.
		-2 channel groups selected makes 12K memory depth available.
		-1 channel group selected makes 24K memory depth available.

6/29/2010 Test Release 2.11
	-Extends memory depths from 8k, and 16k to 12k, and 24k
	-Fixes RLE for all memory depths. (Note: Be sure that channel group 4 is selected when using RLE.)
5/25/2010 Test Release 2.04
	-Still uses SPI mode
	-If channel group 3 and 4 is disabled the 8K of memory depth is available.
	-When all channel groups are selected then 4k of memory depth is available.
	-Supports inside and outside number scheme.
	-Supports Test mode.
5/25/2010 Test Release 2.03
	-SPI Mode replaces the UART communications between FPGA and PIC.
	-No support for Test mode or multiple Number Schemes.
4/30/2010 Version 2.01
	-Adds Number Scheme dropdown box to the Sump Java Client
	-Adds Test Mode under Number Scheme dropdown box. Connect a ribbon cable between the Wing connector and the Buffered connector to test all channels.
	-Adds two new flags to the VHDL for Test Mode and Alt Number Scheme
2/10/2010 Version 2.0
	-Multiple BRAM configurations files are included. Modify sram_bram.vhd to select desired.
	-extClockIn, extClockOut, extTriggerIn, and extTriggerOut are all defined, routed to external pins and seem to work in testing.
	-The arm and trigger LED's are connected and are working.
2/9/2010 Version 1.1
	-Extended BRAM to 6Kx32 instead of 4kX32
2/8/2010 Version 1.01
	-Removed LED connections and changed the trx multiplier setting.
	-Renamed core project name so the output file would be Logic_Sniffer.
